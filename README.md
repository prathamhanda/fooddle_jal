# **Fooddle - Smart Campus Dining**

## **Overview**
Fooddle is a smart food ordering platform designed to simplify campus dining.  
At our campus event, we **used Fooddle to sell water bottles online**.  
Students selected quantity, entered their phone number, and were redirected to a **payment app** to complete the order.
